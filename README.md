# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Importing math module in program
### Step 2: 
Assigning 2 list for matrix calculation
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the statements
### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:

import math
x1,y1 = 4,2
x2,y2 = 10,6
distance= math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 +(y2-y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```
